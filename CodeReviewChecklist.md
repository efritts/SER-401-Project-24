### Code Review Checklist

> The following is a very basic checklist for performing code reviews as part of pull requests.

- [ ] Am I able to understand the code easily?
- [ ] Is the code written following the coding standards/guidelines?
- [ ] Is the same code duplicated more than twice?
- [ ] Can I unit test / debug the code easily to find the root cause?
- [ ] Is this function or class too big? If yes, is the function or class having too many responsibilities?
