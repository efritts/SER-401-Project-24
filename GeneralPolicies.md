**Scrum Processes**

>Sprints will last 2 weeks.

>The day a sprint ends, a retrospective meeting will be held.

>Immediately following the retrospective meeting, there will be a sprint planning meeting.  This meeting will be used to finalize User Stories, assign points where needed, and determine which User Stories to accomplish during the sprint to meet our sprint goal.

>The sprint will start the day after the retrospective and planning meeting.

>A new sprint planning meeting will now be scheduled and the process will repeat.

**General Provisions**

>It is understood that not all members will be available for all meetings.  Meeting minutes/synopsis will be posted for team members to review and comment on asynchronously.  If unable to attend, this review and commenting will count as meeting participation.

>If there is a conflict on how best to satisfy a sponsor requirement ***where sponsor has no preference***, the conflict will be resolved by group concensus.  With a 5 member team, a simple majority decides the resolution.
