>Sprints will last 2 weeks.

**General Provisions**

>It is understood that not all members will be available for all meetings.  Meeting minutes/synopsis will be posted for team members to review and comment on asynchronously.  If unable to attend, this review and commenting will count as meeting participation.

>If there is a conflict on how best to satisfy a sponsor requirement ***where sponsor has no preference***, the conflict will be resolved by group concensus.  With a 5 member team, a simple majority decides the resolution.
